					<ul class="graid3-ul" style="align:left;list-style: disc;">
					
            	<p>In this internship, I developed a software to help mining industry to get particle size distribution curve automatically. After I presented this software to investors of our institute, we <b> got funding </b> from investors to continue this project! </p><p>&nbsp</p> <p>In mining industry, it is necessary to get particle size distribution curve to measure stability of waste rock. They use this information combined with chemistry and geology theory to calculate if stone pile can be reused. Usually, they measure it manully which has low precision and vey time consuming.</p> <p>&nbsp</p> <p>With my software, they can use phone to take photos and use this software to get particle size distribution curve. This software helps them <b>reduce more than 80% labor cost!</b> </p>

					<h4><b>Welcome to my blog!</b></h4>
					<ul class="graid3-ul" style="align:left;list-style: disc;">
						<p>In this blog, I record my life feelings, my learning progress also some useful technique tips.</p> <p>&nbsp</p>
                    
                    <h4><b>Why Software Engineer?</b></h4>                                            
                        <p> When I was a freshman, I like reading philosophy books. I feel confused about several ordinary problems. WHO I AM, WHERE I WANNA BE and WHAT IS MY LIFE MEANING. I thought day by day, but no answer. >^<  I believe that if you do not know yourself, everything is meaningless. Going to a university is meaningless, working is meaningless, and making money is much more meaningless. However, I cannot find answer at that time. I joined lots of volunteer commities at that time. Because during helping people, even I just do insignificant little things, I could feel that I have the meaning of existence.  One day, I attended a conference, in that conference, I heard someone said that, <b> Even you do not know what is your life goal now, you should work hard, otherwise, one day you will find that you do not have ability to achieve your goal.</b> I love this idea and I want to do some significant things to this world, so after that I worked hard on my study. If you are confused about the same questions, hope this idea also can help you.</p><p>&nbsp</p> <p>In my sophomore,  I fall in love with coding. First reason, I love thing which has true and false. Secondly, computer science can do lots of <b> amazing things</b> which will totally change human's life methods. Third reason, I love Matrix, Westworld etc. These movies make me feel interested in AI. Now I am a beginner of Maching Learning Computer Vision. Forth reason, in computer science area, I have lots of chance to learn new knowledge. From new language to new domain knowledage. Never feel boring. </p> <p>&nbsp</p>  
                    <h4><b>What is my career goal?</b></h4>    
                    <p>Now, I learn knowledge which I am interested to learn everyday. My short goal is finding a software development internship to practice my engineer ability. Then find a full time position in Software Engineer area. Maybe begin from back-end, and grow up to a full stack developer. At the same time, I will keep to learn machine learning, deep learning, domain knowledge. My dream career is a Machine Learning/ Deep Learning Enginner! In the future, hope I could develop some amazing projects to help human life better. </p></ul>
